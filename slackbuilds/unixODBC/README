The unixODBC Project goals are to develop and promote unixODBC to be the 
definitive standard for ODBC on non MS Windows platforms.  This is to 
include GUI support for both KDE and GNOME.  ODBC is an open specification 
for providing application developers with a predictable API with which to 
access Data Sources.  Data Sources include SQL Servers and any Data Source 
with an ODBC Driver.

This will be compiled without GUI support since the version of Qt shipped
with Slackware is too new for it; if you want to give it a try, edit the 
build script and comment out the "--disable-gui" configure argument.
